# CZ1015
A project for CZ1015 - Introduction to Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence, AY2018/2019 Semester 2.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the type of cuisine given the recipe (list of ingredients), by using simple machine learning models.

## Technologies
* Python
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * Pandas
  * Plotly

## Models Used
* LinearSVC
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Voting Classifier utilizing the other classifiers

## Data
The training data is obtained from [What's Cooking? | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data).
